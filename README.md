# Timed Quiz

There is an image titled screenshot.png in the Assets folder. It is a screenshot of my webpage. My repository may be found at https://github.com/JoseBurgos1993/Timed-Quiz. Here is a link to the deployed web page, https://joseburgos1993.github.io/Timed-Quiz/.

For this project, I was tasked to create a timed quiz. The first screen shown is a main menu containing the basic rules of the quiz, a 'Start' button to start the quiz, and a 'Highscore' button to view the highscores. The header and the footer of the page are consistent in their size and location.

The 'Start' button gives you a 3 second countdown to the quiz, at which point it will start. There are 10 total questions and you get 30 seconds to finish. The user is shown a question, a timer ticking down from 30 seconds, and 3 answer choices as buttons. Clicking a button will take you to the next question. If you were correct, you gain 5 points and are told you were right at the bottom. If you were wrong, you are told you are wrong at the bottom and you lose 5 seconds from your time limit. Once the quiz is over, you are shown your final score. A button will appear to take you back to the main menu. If you beat one of the 3 top scores, you are also shown a form wherein you may type in your initials (3 character max) and submit. If you do not submit a high score, it will not be saved.

The high score screen shows you a table containing the top 3 scores. These are stored locally. There is a button to take you back to the main menu. Blank scores are filled in with 'xxx' for the name and a score of 0.

I've tested the deployed page on my phone. The only issue I found is the button sizes. The smaller screen leads to many buttons have to grow to fit the given text. Except for the button leading to the highscore screen which has a fixed size, so it slightly cuts off the last letter.
